## Setup 
### Metaflow
You can either deploy Metaflow following the [documentation](https://outerbounds.com/engineering/welcome/), or [use Outerbounds](https://outerbounds.com/get-started/) for a manged version with a 30-day free trial.

You can find detailed instructions for setting up dependencies for each task in the links in the following section.

## Tasks
**[Cell classification](./cell-classification/)**: Fine-tune the pretrained Geneformer on a custom dataset (or the example, as demonstrated in this repository).
